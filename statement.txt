Statement of Code Inspiration and Attribution

In the development of the DynamicArray class for my project, I referenced and was inspired by a publicly available tutorial on YouTube titled "Learn Merge Sort in 13 minutes" by "BroCode" (URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3j0SWDX4AtU&t=522s). While the code I implemented was written independently, the underlying concepts, particularly the approach to merging, were influenced by the explanation provided in the video. I have adapted these ideas to suit the specific requirements of my assignment, ensuring that the implementation aligns with the constraints and goals of the project.

In the implementation of the k_cool function within my warmup.py file, I included a modular_exponentiation function to efficiently compute large exponentiations under a modulus. The design of this function was inspired by an algorithm discussed on the Crypto Stack Exchange (URL: https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/75408/efficient-function-algorithm-method-to-do-modular-exponentiation).
